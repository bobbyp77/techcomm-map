# Tech Comm on a Map

> **Update on October 14th, 2018:** Hallo folks, I’ve decided to take down _Tech Comm on a Map_. 
This means I’ll remove the web page and unpublish the Android app. The web page will remain
available until the end of November 2018, to give people time to fix up any pages that are using it.
The Android app will remain installed on your device if you’ve previously installed it, but it won’t
be available for new installations. My
[blog post](https://ffeathers.wordpress.com/2018/10/14/shutting-down-tech-comm-on-a-map)
has more information.

_Tech Comm on a Map_ is an interactive map containing items of information
that are of interest to technical communicators. See it in action on the
web: [Tech Comm on a Map](http://sarahmaddox.github.io/techcomm-map/).

For more information about the app and project, see
this page:
